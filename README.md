# Next-Word Prediction Model

## Overview
The Next-Word Prediction Model is a machine learning project that uses TensorFlow to predict the next word in a sentence. The model is initially trained on a book PDF and can be fine-tuned by users with their dataset to make predictions according to their preferences. This repository contains a single Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) file with the complete code for preprocessing and model training.

## Features
- **Next-Word Prediction:** Predicts the next word in a sentence based on the given context.
- **TensorFlow Implementation:** Uses TensorFlow for building and training the model.
- **Fine-Tuning Capability:** Users can fine-tune the model with their dataset to customize the predictions.
- **Reference Notebook:** Includes a Jupyter Notebook with all the necessary code for preprocessing and training.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Programming language used for model development.
- **TensorFlow:** Machine learning framework used for building and training the next-word prediction model.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive notebook used for code development and demonstration.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhisek-13/Next_Word_Predictor_using_LSTM.ipynb.git
    cd next-word-prediction
    ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Next_Word_Predictor_using_LSTM.ipynb
    ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data and train the model.
3. Fine-tune the model with your dataset by replacing the reference book PDF with your data.
4. Use the trained model to make next-word predictions.
